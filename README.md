Dotfiles
=============

A (probably) sane set of configuration files


Quick install
===============

Just run

```
 curl -L http://github.com/dssg/dotfiles/raw/master/installer.sh | sh
```


*NOTE*: Edit `gitconfig` to add your credentials and name

*NOTE*: This is very oriented to @nanounanue workflow, so, I use `tmux` and `emacs` so you need to edit `env` and `alias` and change that to your editor of choose.
